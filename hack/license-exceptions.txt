# License Check Exceptions List
# One package path per line, these packages will be ignored during license checks
# For example:
# github.com/example/package
#
# Note: Adding exceptions should be done carefully and with sufficient justification

# Project's own packages don't need to be checked
github.com/go-pantheon/fabrica-util

# Dependencies containing assembly code that cannot be fully checked
# These contain ARM64 assembly optimized code, go-licenses cannot analyze their dependencies
github.com/cespare/xxhash/v2
github.com/golang/snappy
github.com/klauspost/compress/zstd/internal/xxhash
# Changing to github.com/klauspost/compress would exclude the entire library
